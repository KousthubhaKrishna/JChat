# JChat

JChat is an android real-time messaging or chatting application with the aim of connecting remote clients in an organized manner. Unlike the conventional chat apps, this app provides a user to customize their chats based on the categories like Personal, Close Friends, Business and Others and be able to modify their preferences easily. The project is developed in two phases, in the first phase a simple one to one chat functionality is planned to be developed and in the later phase, we also aim to provide the functionality to identify and connect to nearby users on a request. Additionally, it is also planned to include a group chat mechanism along with a provision to share other forms of data apart from text messages.

JChat is developed using Android and Firebase.
